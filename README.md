# hello-world


I'm a USC grad student majoring in Electrical engineering, with a specialisation in VLSI. The courses I've taken so far are - Computer systems organization, MOS VLSI Design, Software Design and Optimization, Analysis of algorithms, VLSI Design I, VLSI Design II & finally, Design for Testability (DFT). 

The course codes are:
EE457
EE477L
EE595
CSCI570
EE577A
EE577B
EE658

Despite being in the hardware domain I love the software side of engineering too. Machine Learning and AI is another field which I'm utterly fascinated by and hopefully get to work with in the future!
